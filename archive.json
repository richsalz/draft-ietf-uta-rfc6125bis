We make this suggestion because a deployment that can be attacked in this way might be vulnerable based on the weakest configuration it is willing to negotiate. Though TLS guarantees that a connection will choose the server's choice from mutually-supported features, in a cross-protocol attack the attack might steer clients toward a server that has a weaker configuration.\r\n\r\nThe SHOULD on ALPN is really the crux of the cross-protocol defense though. the key is that ALPN provides an authenticated way for the client and server to agree on the protocol that is in use. that trumps anything else here. if you have that, then the crypto configuration stuff is more or less pointless.\r\n\r\nI would commit to doing this properly by starting a new section on how to manage the cross-protocol thing. Focus on ALPACA there. Not doing ALPN is only OK to the extent that the protocols that might be used cannot be misinterpreted and that's not an easy thing to guarantee, thanks to \"robust\" or creative interpretation of protocol elements being commonplace.\r\n\r\nFor this section, concentrate on the SNI issue. Not doing SNI is mostly OK in protocols that unambiguously identify the identity they are using (HTTP's Host header field, for instance). Not doing SNI in protocols without clear identity signals in-protocol - signals that are really used, everywhere - is just as bad as not doing ALPN.\r\n\r\nThe DROWN thing is definitely a risk, but DROWN was due to the configuration including options that were too weak to ensure that the TLS guarantee. You might mention DROWN and emphasize that certain types of weakness in crypto can undermine the guarantee TLS provides about its negotiation of parameters, but it doesn't really belong here from what I can see.\r\n",

I think that you already have much of what you need in Section 6.1.1.\r\n\r\nWhere it says:\r\n\r\nThe client might need to extract the source domain and application service type from the input(s) it has received.\r\n\r\nYou might instead say:\r\n\r\nThis document doesn't precisely define how reference identifiers are derived.Applications that use this document need to define how reference identifiers are determined. The security of a system that uses this document will depend on how reference identifiers are obtained.\r\n\r\nThen back to the existing language:\r\n\r\nNaturally, if the inputs themselves are invalid or corrupt (e.g., a user has clicked a link provided by a malicious entity in a phishing attack), then the client might end up communicating with an unexpected application service.\r\n\r\nThen for this text, we have a case where the system might handle an identifier that looks like a reference identifier, but it isn't. What we're really saying here is:\r\n\r\nDuring the course of processing, a client might be exposed to identifiers that look like reference identifiers. For example, DNS resolution that starts at a DNS-ID reference identifier might produce intermediate domain names that need to be further resolved.\r\n\r\nAny intermediate values are not reference identifiers and MUST NOT be treated as such, except as defined by the application. In the DNS case, not treating intermediate domain names as reference identifiers removes DNS and DNS resolution from the attack surface. An application might define a process for authenticating these intermediate identifiers in a way that then allows them to be used as a reference identifier; see for example {{?RFC8689}}.",

      "body": "Some comments on a read-through if not too late:\r\n\r\n1) On DNS names starting with Labels:\r\n\r\n> historically this rule was also intended to apply to all labels in a domain name (see [Section 2.3.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-2.3.1) of [[DNS-NAMES](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035)]), although that is not always the case in practice.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be more clear that domain names are explicitly allowed to start with digits.  As per  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123#section-2.1 and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181#section-11 clearly update this.  For example from the former clearly states:\r\n\"One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal syntax\"\r\n\r\n2) On the Web example:\r\n\r\n>Consider a simple website at www.example.com, which is not discoverable via DNS SRV lookups. Because HTTP does not specify the use of URIs in server certificates, a certificate for this service might include only a DNS-ID of www.example.com.\r\n> Consider the same website, which is reachable by a fixed IP address of 2001:db8::5c. The certificate might include this value in an IP-ID to allow clients to use the fixed IP address as a reference identity.\r\n\r\nThis would not be the same \"website\".  In particular, the web origin (rfc6454) is the tuple of scheme, authority, and port.  Since the authority is different (ie, the IP vs the hostname) they would be distinct.   If we're going to include this example, we should be clear that https://www.example.com/ and https://[2001:db8::5c]/ might be multi-tenant on the same server but are different web origins (ie, different \"websites\")\r\n\r\n3) Example in 6.1.2 (nit)\r\nPer https://www.iab.org/2016/11/07/iab-statement-on-ipv6/ it would also be worth including some more IPv6 examples in the examples (eg, for \"https://[2001:db8::abcd]\" as an example origin, perhaps augmenting the existing IPv4 examples so we always have both?)\r\n\r\n4) Clarification on IP address matching\r\n>For an IP address that appears in a URI-ID, the \"host\" component of both the reference identity and the presented identifier must match. These are parsed as either an \"IP-literal\" (following [[IPv6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4291)]) or an \"IPv4address\" (following [[IPv4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791)]). If the resulting octets are equal, the IP address matches.\r\n\r\nIn the IPv6 case, it may be better to reference https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 section 3.2.2 since what is being matched isn't \"IP-literal\" (which is in square brackets) per the below ABNF but the address inside those brackets:\r\n\r\n      IP-literal = \"[\" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) \"]\"\r\n\r\nThere is also the case of https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6874 (which allows zoneids) but since the zoneid has host scope it makes no sense for it to be included in how certs are verified.  (But perhaps there should be a requirement that the IPv6 IP-ID address NOT be LinkLocal?)\r\n\r\n",

[...] However, an application might define a process for\r\nauthenticating these intermediate identifiers in a way that then allows them to\r\nbe used as a reference identifier; see for example [SMTP-TLS].\" -  erm... I\r\nknow what you are trying to say here (at least I think that I do), but, as\r\nwritten this seems logically inconsistant.  Perhaps something like: \"Unless an\r\napplication defines a process for authenticating intermediate identifiers in a\r\nway that then allows them to be used as a reference identifier (see for example\r\n[SMTP-TLS]), any intermediate values are not reference identifiers and MUST NOT\r\nbe treated as such.\"... or something...\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n\"Note also that by policy, Top-Level Domains ([DNS-TERMS]) do not start with a\r\ndigit (see Section 2.2.1.3.2 of [ICANN-AGB]); ...\" - yup, that does indeed seem\r\nto be the current policy, but another round of new TLDs seems imminent and it\r\nisn't clear (to me at least) that this will always be true. Should the document\r\nnote that this is not set in stone?\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI agree with Eric's comments / suggestions re: support of the new SVCB\r\n(draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https) mechanism. Unless there is a really good reason\r\nto not mention it, it seems like it should be discussed.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to thank the DNSDIR ( Petr \u0160pa\u010dek -\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-uta-rfc6125bis-12-dnsdir-lc-spacek-2023-06-21/) and OPSDIR ( Quin Wu -\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-uta-rfc6125bis-08-opsdir-early-wu-2022-12-16/) for their helpful reviews, and to the authors for working with them to address the comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This enables a single certificate\r\nto be used across multiple hostnames, such as when a client does not\r\nsupport the TLS SNI extension, or across multiple protocols, such as\r\nSMTP and HTTP, on a single hostname. The use of a single certificate\r\nand public/private keypair in such environments MAY facilitate\r\ncross-protocol attacks, particularly when used in differing TLS\r\nconfigurations. See, for example, {{ALPCA}}, {{DROWN}}. Server\r\noperators SHOULD take steps to mitigate the risk of cross-protocol\r\nattacks, such as ensuring all TLS endpoints using a given certificate\r\nsupport exactly the same TLS version(s) and ciphersuite(s), and\r\nSHOULD make use of the TLS ALPN extension to ensure the correct\r\nprotocol is used.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Reference Identifiers\r\n\r\nThis specification describes how a client may construct multiple\r\nacceptable reference identifiers, and may match any of those reference\r\nidentifiers with the set of presented identifiers. {{PKIX, Section 4.2.1.10}}\r\ndescribes a mechanism to allow CA certificates to be constrained in the\r\nset of presented identifiers that they may include within server certificates.\r\nHowever, these constraints only apply to the explicitly enumerated name\r\nforms. For example, a CA that is only name constrained for DNS-IDs is not\r\nconstrained for SRV-IDs and URI-IDs, unless those name forms are also\r\nexplicitly included within the name constraints extension.\r\n\r\nA client that constructs multiple reference identifiers of different types,\r\nsuch as both DNS-ID and SRV-IDs, as described in\r\n{#verify-reference-rules}, SHOULD take care to ensure that CAs issuing\r\nsuch certificates are appropriately constrained. This MAY take the form of\r\nlocal policy through agreement with the issuing CA, or MAY be enforced by\r\nthe client requiring that if one form of presented identifier is constrained,\r\nsuch as a dNSName name constraint for DNS-IDs, then all other forms of\r\nacceptable reference identities are also constrained, such as requiring a\r\nuniformResourceIndicator name constraint for URI-IDs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a huge mouthful, and is really meant to be a rough draft for starting discussion, because it definitely reads awkwardly. However, it tries to get the concept out, but I'm not entirely sure on the usage of the 2119 language here either.",

There is no normative language about having the same versions and configuration (it's also key exchange methods, by the way), which is OK, but only if you explain why this is the case.  We make this suggestion because a deployment that can be attacked in this way might be vulnerable based on the weakest configuration it is willing to negotiate.  Though TLS guarantees that a connection will choose the server's choice from mutually-supported features, in a cross-protocol attack the attack might steer clients toward a server that has a weaker configuration.\r\n\r\n2. the SHOULD on ALPN is really the crux of the cross-protocol defense though.  the key is that ALPN provides an authenticated way for the client and server to agree on the protocol that is in use.  that trumps anything else here.  if you have that, then the crypto configuration stuff is more or less pointless.\r\n\r\nI would commit to doing this properly by starting a new section on how to manage the cross-protocol thing.  Focus on ALPACA there.  Not doing ALPN is only OK to the extent that the protocols that might be used cannot be misinterpreted and that's not an easy thing to guarantee, thanks to \"robust\" or creative interpretation of protocol elements being commonplace.\r\n\r\nFor this section, concentrate on the SNI issue.  Not doing SNI is mostly OK in protocols that unambiguously identify the identity they are using (HTTP's Host header field, for instance).  Not doing SNI in protocols without clear identity signals in-protocol - signals that are really used, everywhere - is just as bad as not doing ALPN.\r\n\r\nThe DROWN thing is definitely a risk, but DROWN was due to the configuration including options that were too weak to ensure that the TLS guarantee.  You might mention DROWN and emphasize that certain types of weakness in crypto can undermine the guarantee TLS provides about its negotiation of parameters, but it doesn't really belong here from what I can see.",

Slightly better since srv-id's are structured, but still, certificates are typed data and we should not have to guess at the semantics of fields.\r\n\r\nIf the standards fail to extend the semantics of DNS-ID name constraints to cover other constructs that augment DNS names with additional context, then so much the worse for the standards. Perhaps it is time to admit that X.509 name constraints are a spectacular failure, that nobody uses and nobody should expect to work?",

What we're really saying here is:\r\n\r\n> During the course of processing, a client might be exposed to identifiers that look like reference identifiers.  For example, DNS resolution that starts at a DNS-ID reference identifier might produce intermediate domain names that need to be further resolved.\r\n>\r\n> Any intermediate values are not reference identifiers and MUST NOT be treated as such, except as defined by the application.  In the DNS case, not treating intermediate domain names as reference identifiers removes DNS and DNS resolution from the attack surface.
